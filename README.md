## Objective
As Formula 1 enthusiast, participating in a Formula 1 fantasy league is an entertaining way to keep up with the sport. This dataset is great to see if I will be able to optimize the driver and constructor selections for my Formula 1 fantasy team.

The Formula 1 fantasy league is based on a selecting a team of 5 drivers and 1 constructor week to week with a budget of $100MM dollars to acquire the various drivers.

As with any fantasy sport, we all want to have an edge over our competition and why not use data to our advantage. Hopefully this will help others with some insight in how the can improve their fantasy team selection.

What this notebook will aim to do:
* Explore the dataset and see if there are any correlations and trends regarding the available data
* Data cleaning and formatting in order to have the data useful for manipulation
* Visualize the trends for optimal fantasy points value
* Identify the optimal Formula 1 fantasy team week by week to maximize overall fantasy point performance over the course of the season (2021)
